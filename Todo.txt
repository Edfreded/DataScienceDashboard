bugs
plotly vh does not scale properly
    smaller screens have overflow
    plotly does not stay within given layout bounds. it should scale at the same rate of the ui Cards
        it scales up (bigger) perfectly fine, bu scaling down does not happen
    when browser window size is too small, you have too scroll, which i like, but on smaller screens, you get overlapping plotly
